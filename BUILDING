Building Binary Distributions
=============================

Distributions are generated using stdeb, execute it on the Raspberry Pi to build for the correct architecture:

    python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb

To debug installation:

    sudo dpkg -D113 -i ../python-tallypi_0.1.0-1_all.deb

To completely uninstall:

    sudo dpkg -P python-tallypi

To verify the files inside the package:

    dpkg -c deb_dist/python-tallypi_0.1.0-1_all.deb


Requirements
============

Requires python-stdeb and debhelper


Generating Debian Metadata
==========================

stdeb generates the debian/ folder automatically & this is version controlled.
However, if it needs regeneration one can save python-tallypi.postinst to a
separate directory, delete the debian/ directory, then re-issue:

    python ./setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command debianize


Running Locally
===============

To test locally:

    export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/Projects/tally_pi/lib"
    cd srv/tallypi
    ../../scripts/run_server.py --config "$HOME/Projects/tally_pi/tests/localsettings.conf"
